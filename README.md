# ohmyhcl
A playground for experimenting with hclwrite and tfupdate, inspired by hcledit. In the spirit of [`ohmyzsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), the vision of this 
repository is to bundle different helpful tools for managing your HCL configurations, namely Terraform, and perhaps one day become an interactive framework.

## Description

This repository currently houses the experimental tools [`tfrefactor`](./tfrefactor) and upcoming `tfimportgen` to assist migrating terraform configurations from v3 Terraform AWS Provider to v4 where S3 bucket refactoring is necessary.
